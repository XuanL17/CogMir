# Experimental Prompt Templates

This directory contains the templates used to generate prompts for the specific cognitive bias experiments conducted in the CogMir project.

Each subfolder is dedicated to one cognitive bias. Within each, you'll find `.txt` files representing the prompt structure for different experimental setups (e.g., survey vs. simulation).

**Using the Templates:**
These files contain **placeholders** (e.g., `[Known/Unknown MCQ]`, `[IDENTITY]`, `[SCENARIO]`) that are meant to be replaced with specific data drawn from the `/Core_Datasets` directory. This allows for the systematic generation of numerous unique experimental trials based on a consistent structure.

Refer to **Appendix D** of the paper for the specific context and examples of how these templates are used.
