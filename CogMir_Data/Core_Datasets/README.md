# Core Datasets

This directory houses the foundational datasets for the CogMir framework. These datasets provide the specific inputs (questions, agent identities, scenarios, etc.) needed to instantiate the experimental prompts found in the `/Experimental_Prompts` directory.

Each subfolder corresponds to a dataset described in **Appendix C** of the associated paper. Please consult the README within each subfolder for details on its format and intended use.
